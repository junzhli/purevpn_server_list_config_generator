# PureVPN OpenVPN Config Generator

## Introduction

This is a script for user to fetch the latest list released from official website.

Because I use VPN via OpenVPN protocol more often, I found the OpenVPN config files from official website is not updated with the offical server list. I have contacted with PureVPN support team and it may wait for a long time... :(

So if you encountered the same problem, it can help you!

Hope you can enjoy it!
